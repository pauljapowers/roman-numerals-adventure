        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Cato introduces the Republic:</strong>
            “Now Rome decides that no single king should rule. Citizens vote, senators debate,
            and heroes write letters home from far‑away wars. Welcome to five hundred years
            of the Roman Republic!”
        </div>

        <p>
            The <strong>Roman Republic</strong> lasted for about 500 years. During this time,
            Romans experimented with new ways of sharing power. Ordinary citizens had more
            of a voice, but life was still very different for rich and poor people. Many
            famous stories, wars, and leaders come from this period.

        <div id="r1" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>1. Republic Government</h2>
            <p>
                In the Roman Republic, leaders were chosen by citizens instead of crowned as kings.
                There were two main officials called <strong>consuls</strong> who shared power and
                could stop each other’s decisions. A group called the <strong>Senate</strong> advised
                them, and different assemblies allowed citizens to vote on some laws.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. Comparison, US and Roman Republic Governments -->
        <div id="r2" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>2. Comparing the US and Roman Republic Governments</h2>
            <p>
                Like the Roman Republic, the United States has elected leaders, a senate, and written
                laws. Both systems try to balance power so no single person controls everything.
                However, many people in Rome could not vote, including women and enslaved people,
                while modern democracies try to give more citizens a voice.

        </div>

        <!-- 3. SPQR -->
        <div id="r3" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>3. SPQR</h2>
            <p>
                The letters <strong>SPQR</strong> stand for <em>Senatus Populusque Romanus</em>,
                which means “The Senate and People of Rome”. Romans carved SPQR on buildings,
                flags, and shields to show that government came from both the leaders and the citizens.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. 12 Tables -->
        <div id="r4" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>4. The Twelve Tables</h2>
            <p>
                Early in the Republic, Romans wrote down their laws on bronze tablets called
                the <strong>Twelve Tables</strong>. These tablets were displayed in the Forum so
                that everyone could see the rules. This helped stop powerful people from secretly
                changing laws to suit themselves.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Crime and Justice in Ancient Rome -->
        <div id="r5" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>5. Crime and Justice in Ancient Rome</h2>
            <p>
                Romans took law and order seriously. People accused of crimes could sometimes speak
                in their own defence or have a lawyer. Punishments included fines, exile from the city,
                or, for serious crimes, death. Rich people often had better chances in court than poor people.

        <div id="r6" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>6. Daily Life for Patricians</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Patricians</strong> were wealthy families with large houses and many slaves.
                They enjoyed fancy dinners, political meetings, and trips to the baths. Their children
                sometimes had private tutors who taught them reading, writing, Greek, and public speaking.

        <div id="r7" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>7. Daily Life for Plebeians</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Plebeians</strong> were ordinary citizens such as farmers, shopkeepers, and craftsmen.
                Many lived in crowded apartment buildings. They worked hard during the day and relaxed by
                visiting the market, the baths, or the games in the arena when they could.

        <div id="r8" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>8. Daily Life in the Countryside</h2>
            <p>
                Outside the city, many Romans lived on farms. Families grew grain, olives, grapes, and raised
                animals like sheep and goats. Life followed the seasons: planting, harvesting, and caring for
                crops. News from Rome sometimes arrived only after many days.

        <div id="r9" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>9. Roman Houses and the Atrium</h2>
            <p>
                Wealthy Romans lived in houses with an open central hall called an <strong>atrium</strong>.
                Rainwater fell through a hole in the roof into a pool on the floor. Rooms opened around
                the atrium, and guests could admire family shrines, statues, and colourful wall paintings.

            <p>
                Roman citizens often wore a simple tunic, and on special days men might add a
                <strong>toga</strong>, a large draped cloth. Women wore long dresses called
                <strong>stolae</strong> and styled their hair in braids or curls. Wealthy people
                might use pins and jewellery to show their status.

        <div id="r11" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>11. Bulla</h2>
            <p>
                Roman children were given a small locket called a <strong>bulla</strong> to wear
                around their necks. It contained lucky charms to protect them from harm. Boys
                usually wore their bulla until they became adults and put on a man’s toga.

        <div id="r12" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>12. The Forum</h2>
            <p>
                During the Republic, the Forum was busier than ever. Citizens met there to trade,
                listen to court cases, and hear speeches from politicians. If you stood in the
                Forum, you might hear arguments about new laws or news from distant provinces.

            <p>
                Public bath houses were like a mix of a swimming pool, gym, and social club.
                Romans could exercise, wash in hot and cold pools, and relax with friends.
                Many baths also had libraries and snack stalls, making them popular meeting places.

            <p>
                Romans worked in many different jobs: farmers, soldiers, builders, merchants,
                scribes, and more. Some people ran small shops, while others worked on large
                estates or in government offices. Enslaved people did much of the hardest labour.

            <p>
                Many Roman children learned at home or in small schools run by teachers.
                They practised writing on wax tablets, memorised poems, and learned
                multiplication with counting boards. Good handwriting and clear speaking
                were very important skills.

                Roman weddings included special clothes, music, and feasts. Brides wore a bright
                orange veil and carried a small torch. After the ceremony, guests shouted
                good wishes as the couple walked to their new home.

                Romans decorated floors and walls with <strong>mosaics</strong>, pictures made
                from tiny pieces of coloured stone or glass. Mosaics showed animals, gods,
                and scenes from everyday life. They were beautiful and also easier to clean

                Citizens served as soldiers, training to march in formation and use shields and swords.
                Successful generals gained great fame and sometimes used their armies to win political power.

            <p>
                Soldiers and travellers sometimes wrote letters home on thin wooden tablets or papyrus.
                Important messages and honours were carved into stone <strong>inscriptions</strong>.
                Archaeologists still discover these writings today, giving us a peek into real Roman voices.

            <h2>20. Roman Roads</h2>
            <p>
                As Rome conquered more land, it built sturdy roads to move soldiers and goods.
                These roads connected new provinces to the city of Rome. Mile‑stones along the
                way told travellers how far they were from the capital.

            <h2>21. Provinces &amp; Expansion</h2>
            <p>
                Lands outside Italy that Rome controlled were called <strong>provinces</strong>.
                Governors were sent to collect taxes and keep order. Some provinces became rich
                from trade in grain, metals, or wine, but others suffered from heavy taxation
                and unfair treatment.

            <p>
                During the late Republic and early Empire, Roman armies reached the island of Britain.
                They built forts, roads, and walls, including the famous Hadrian’s Wall. Roman rule
                brought new foods, coins, and baths, but also battles with local tribes.

            <h2>23. The Aeneid by Virgil</h2>
            <p>
                The poet <strong>Virgil</strong> wrote an epic poem called the <em>Aeneid</em>.
                It tells the story of Aeneas, a brave Trojan who travels to Italy and becomes
                an ancestor of the Romans. The poem linked Rome’s past to the heroic tales of
                the Trojan War and gave the Republic a grand, mythical origin.

                Rome fought three long wars against the city of Carthage, called the
                <strong>Punic Wars</strong>. The Carthaginian general <strong>Hannibal</strong>
                became famous for leading war elephants across the Alps to surprise the Romans.
                After many battles, Rome finally won and became the strongest power in the western Mediterranean.

                <strong>Julius Caesar</strong> was a brilliant general who conquered Gaul and
                became extremely popular. He used his army to gain control of Rome and was named
                “dictator for life”. Some senators feared he would make himself king, so they
                plotted against him and assassinated him on the Ides of March.

            <p>
                By the end of the Republic, Rome was full of problems: rich and poor citizens
                argued, generals used their armies to win power, and civil wars broke out.
                After Caesar’s death, his adopted heir Octavian defeated his rivals and
                became the first emperor, Augustus. The Republic was over, and the Empire had begun.
