            Historians call the first part of Rome’s story the <strong>Roman Kingdom</strong>.
            It lasted for about 200 years and was ruled by a line of kings. Some of
            these kings may be legendary, but their stories help us understand what
            early Romans admired: bravery, cleverness, and respect for the gods.

            <h2>1. How Ancient Romans Differed from Ancient Greeks</h2>
            <p>
                The Romans admired the Greeks, but they were not the same. Greek cities
                loved art, ideas, and debates. Romans liked these things too, but they
                also focused on order, laws, and building a strong army. Greeks told
                stories about heroes who searched for glory, while Romans praised leaders
                who served their city and kept their promises.

            <p>
                Rome grew beside the River Tiber in central Italy. The city was surrounded
                by seven hills, which made it easier to defend. Nearby fields provided
                grain, olives, and grapes for food and trade. Because Italy sticks out
                into the Mediterranean Sea like a boot, Roman ships could easily reach
                many other lands.

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Map idea:</strong>
                “Later, you can add a map here showing the River Tiber, the seven hills,
                and the Mediterranean Sea. Try drawing Rome in the centre and colouring
                the sea bright blue.”

            <h2>3. The Etruscans</h2>
            <p>
                Before Rome became powerful, a people called the <strong>Etruscans</strong>
                lived in northern and central Italy. They were skilled metalworkers and
                builders. Romans learned many things from them, including how to build
                arches and how to read certain signs from the gods. Some of Rome’s early
                kings were probably Etruscan.

            <p>
                According to legend, twin brothers Romulus and Remus were abandoned as
                babies and rescued by a she‑wolf. When they grew up, they decided to
                build a city. A fierce argument followed, and Romulus killed Remus.
                Romulus named the new city <strong>Rome</strong> after himself and became
                its first king.

            <h2>5. Gods &amp; Goddesses</h2>
            <p>
                Early Romans believed that spirits and gods watched over every part of
                life: the home, the fields, and the sky. Later, they matched many of
                their gods with Greek ones. For example, the Roman god Jupiter was
                similar to the Greek god Zeus, and Venus was similar to Aphrodite.

            <h2>6. Roman Council of 12 Gods</h2>
            <p>
                The most important Roman gods were sometimes called the “Council of Twelve”.
                These included Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Neptune,
                Diana, Apollo, Vesta, Ceres, and Vulcan. Temples and festivals were held
                in their honour, and people asked them for protection and good fortune.

            <h2>7. Roman Myths</h2>
            <p>
                Roman myths told exciting stories about brave heroes, magical creatures,
                and powerful gods. These tales explained why storms happened, how cities
                were founded, and what it meant to be loyal and brave. Children in Rome
                grew up hearing these stories just as you might hear fairy tales today.

            <p>
                Many of the planets in our solar system are named after Roman gods.
                Mars, the red planet, is named after the god of war. Venus, the bright
                evening star, is named after the goddess of love and beauty. Even the
                planet Neptune, deep blue in colour, is named after the god of the sea.

            <h2>9. Patricians &amp; Plebeians</h2>
            <p>
                Early Roman society was divided into two main groups:
                <strong>patricians</strong> and <strong>plebeians</strong>. Patricians were
                wealthy families who owned land and often became leaders. Plebeians were
                ordinary citizens such as farmers, craft workers, and traders. Both groups
                were important for building Rome.

            <p>
                In each Roman household, the <strong>pater familias</strong> was the head of
                the family, usually the oldest man. He was expected to care for everyone,
                make decisions, and honour the family’s ancestors. Children were taught
                to obey their parents and to show respect to their elders.

                One famous story from the time of the Roman Kingdom is about
                <strong>Horatius Cocles</strong>. When an enemy army tried to cross a bridge
                into Rome, Horatius stood at the far end and fought them off while the
                bridge was destroyed behind him. He risked his life to protect his city,
                and Romans remembered him as a model of courage and loyalty.
