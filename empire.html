        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Cato tells the tale:</strong>
            “In the Empire, Rome reaches its greatest size. Emperors rule from marble
            palaces, gladiators fight in huge arenas, and roads and aqueducts stretch
            across three continents. Come and see how the story ends!”
        </div>

        <p>
            The <strong>Roman Empire</strong> began after the Republic collapsed and powerful
            emperors took charge. For about 500 years, Rome controlled lands across
            Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. There were times of peace and
            clever building, and other times of danger, fire, and invasion.

        <!-- 1. Roman Emperors -->
        <div id="e1" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>1. Roman Emperors</h2>
            <p>
                The first emperor was <strong>Augustus</strong>, who brought order after years
                of civil war. Later emperors were very different from each other: some were wise
                and careful, others cruel and reckless. Emperors wore purple robes and had guards,
                palaces, and enormous power over millions of people.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. Pax Romana -->
        <div id="e2" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>2. Pax Romana</h2>
            <p>
                The phrase <strong>Pax Romana</strong> means “Roman Peace”. For about 200 years,
                the empire enjoyed relatively few major wars inside its borders. Trade flowed
                along safe roads and sea routes, and cities across the empire grew rich and busy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. Improvements -->
        <div id="e3" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>3. Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                Emperors invested in roads, bridges, aqueducts, and public buildings.
                They improved city planning with sewers and fresh water supplies, and they
                standardised coins and weights. These improvements helped people travel,
                trade, and live more comfortably.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. Roman Calendar -->
        <div id="e4" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>4. Roman Calendar</h2>
            <p>
                Julius Caesar reformed the calendar into a 365‑day year with leap years, called
                the <strong>Julian calendar</strong>. Many of our month names, like March (from
                Mars) and July (from Julius), come from Rome. Later changes created the modern
                calendar we still use today.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Status of Women -->
        <div id="e5" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>5. Status of Women</h2>
            <p>
                Women in the Empire could not vote, but many managed households, helped run
                businesses, and influenced politics behind the scenes. Wealthy women owned
                property and sponsored buildings or games. Some became famous writers and
                philosophers, although their names are less well known than men’s.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 6. Daily Life -->
        <div id="e6" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>6. Daily Life</h2>
            <p>
                A typical day in Rome began with a simple breakfast, work or school during
                the morning, and a rest in the hot afternoon. People might visit the baths,
                shop in markets, or watch entertainment in the evening. Much like today,
                daily life mixed chores with chances to relax.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 7. Breakfast -->
        <div id="e7" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>7. Breakfast</h2>
            <p>
                Roman breakfast, called <em>ientaculum</em>, was often small: bread with
                cheese or olives, and maybe some fruit. Only the wealthy sometimes enjoyed
                fancier foods early in the day.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 8. Afternoon, Siestas -->
        <div id="e8" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>8. Afternoon &amp; Siestas</h2>
            <p>
                The hottest part of the day was often time for a rest or <em>meridiatio</em>.
                Shops might close, and people would nap, play quiet games, or chat at home
                before returning to work later.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 9. Dinner -->
        <div id="e9" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>9. Dinner</h2>
            <p>
                The main meal, <em>cena</em>, could be simple or spectacular. Rich families
                reclined on couches and ate several courses, including fish, meat, vegetables,
                and sweets. Musicians or dancers sometimes performed during the meal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 10. Entertainment -->
        <div id="e10" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>10. Entertainment</h2>
            <p>
                Romans loved entertainment. They watched plays, listened to poetry, and enjoyed
                acrobats, animal shows, and storytelling. Crowds also flocked to chariot races
                and gladiator fights in massive arenas.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 11. Holidays & Festivals -->
        <div id="e11" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>11. Holidays &amp; Festivals</h2>
            <p>
                Festivals honoured gods, emperors, or important events. During <strong>Saturnalia</strong>,
                masters and slaves switched roles for a day, gifts were exchanged, and everyone
                enjoyed feasts and games. Religious ceremonies filled the calendar.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 12. Daily Life in the Country -->
        <div id="e12" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>12. Daily Life in the Country</h2>
            <p>
                In the countryside, farmers worked on large estates, growing crops for cities.
                Life followed the rhythms of planting and harvest. Some estates belonged to
                wealthy Romans who visited only for holidays, leaving managers and workers to
                handle daily tasks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 13. The Campus -->
        <div id="e13" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>13. The Campus</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Campus Martius</strong>, or Field of Mars, was a large open area where
                soldiers trained and young men exercised. Over time, it also gained temples,
                theatres, and baths, becoming a lively part of the city.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 14. Pantomime, Theatre -->
        <div id="e14" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>14. Pantomime &amp; Theatre</h2>
            <p>
                Roman theatres staged comedies, tragedies, and <strong>pantomime</strong>, where
                actors told stories through movement and masks while a chorus sang the words.
                Audiences laughed, cheered, and sometimes loudly complained if a play was boring!
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 15. Circus Maximus, Chariot Races -->
        <div id="e15" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>15. Circus Maximus &amp; Chariot Races</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Circus Maximus</strong> was a huge race track that could hold more than
                100,000 spectators. Teams raced light chariots pulled by horses around the track
                at dangerous speeds. Fans supported their favourite colours—Red, White, Blue, or Green—
                much like sports teams today.

        <div id="e16" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>16. Roman Art</h2>
            <p>
                Roman artists created realistic statues, detailed mosaics, and colourful wall
                paintings. They often copied Greek styles but added their own ideas, showing
                everyday scenes as well as gods and heroes.

        <div id="e17" class="chapter-section">
            <h2>17. Roman Architecture – The Great Builders</h2>
            <p>
                Romans used arches, domes, and concrete to build strong and beautiful structures:
                aqueducts, bridges, temples, and arenas. Their engineering skills were so advanced
                that many Roman buildings still stand today, almost two thousand years later.

            <p>
                Numbers in the Empire were written with letters like I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.
                Romans used them on monuments, in documents, and for counting money and soldiers.
                You have already started to master these numerals in the Arena of Numbers!

                The <strong>Colosseum</strong> is Rome’s most famous amphitheatre. It could hold
                tens of thousands of spectators who came to watch gladiator fights, animal hunts,
                and mock sea battles. Different levels of seats were reserved for different social
                classes, from senators down to ordinary citizens.

            <p>
                <strong>Gladiators</strong> were trained fighters, often enslaved people or
                prisoners of war, who battled each other or wild animals for the crowd’s
                entertainment. Some became famous and won their freedom, but many faced
                great danger in the arena.

            <p>
                Emperor <strong>Nero</strong> is remembered for his strange and cruel behaviour.
                Ancient writers say he loved performing on stage and sometimes ignored his duties.
                A great fire destroyed much of Rome during his rule, and many blamed him, although
                historians still debate what really happened.

            <p>
                <strong>Spartacus</strong> was a gladiator who led a major rebellion of enslaved
                people against Rome. For a time his army defeated several Roman forces, showing
                how dangerous unrest could be inside the empire. In the end, the rebellion was
                crushed, but the story of Spartacus remained famous.

            <p>
                During the Empire, a new religion called <strong>Christianity</strong> began in
                the eastern provinces. At first, Christians were sometimes punished for refusing
                to honour Roman gods. Later, emperors such as Constantine made Christianity legal
                and eventually it became the empire’s main religion.

            <p>
                The empire grew so large that emperors eventually divided it into a western half,
                ruled from Rome, and an eastern half, ruled from Constantinople. The eastern empire,
                often called the Byzantine Empire, lasted for nearly a thousand years after the western
                half fell.

            <p>
                Romans called many neighbouring peoples <strong>barbarians</strong> if they did not
                speak Latin or Greek. Over time, some of these groups, such as the Goths and Vandals,
                pushed into Roman lands. They were sometimes enemies, sometimes allies, and often
                searching for new homes.

            <p>
                In 476 CE, the last western Roman emperor was removed by a Germanic leader
                named Odoacer. Many historians use this date as the “fall” of the western
                Roman Empire. However, Roman laws, language, and buildings continued to
                influence Europe for centuries.

                Romans left behind impressive achievements: straight roads, strong bridges,
                aqueducts that carried water for miles, grand buildings, clear laws, and
                Latin words that shaped many modern languages. When you see arches, domes,

            <p>
                Over its history, Rome tried several types of government: kings, a republic
                with elected officials, and an empire ruled by emperors. Each system had
                strengths and weaknesses. Many later countries studied Rome to learn what
                to copy and what mistakes to avoid.

                The <strong>Pantheon</strong> is a magnificent temple with a huge concrete dome
                and a round opening in the roof called an <em>oculus</em>. Originally built to

                In 79 CE, the volcano Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried the town of
                <strong>Pompeii</strong> under ash and rock. Many people died, but the ash
                also preserved buildings, paintings, and even food. Today, archaeologists
